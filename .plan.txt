1. Design Mindow - DONE
  I want to design a basic window that displays the text "MinGine"

2. Design a world SYSTEM
  The world can be described as the level in a sense. It will be the whole virtual 2d world where
the player will operate.
  Not talking about the world, but the system in which the world will operate
    - I'm thinking like:
      - tile-based
        - this involves mapping tile images to integers
        - also involves drawing the world based on the tile images and returning image of the whole
        world
        -
      - incorporates spawnpoints
      - size
        - This one will be mostly about tile amount. Tilesize will be another thing to
        add to, but this is like 64x64 which means 64 tiles by 64 tiles, not pixels. TileSize
        will be seperately implemented.

2. Design a coordinate system
  There needs to be a "large"(loosely used) world where a "world" or level can be made

3. Design a camera system
  We need to be able to navigate a zoomed in version of the world, instead of looking at world
from a far away perspective


TODO) Add simpleObject called "Mobject"
  No animation, just generates it in a World coordinate system
